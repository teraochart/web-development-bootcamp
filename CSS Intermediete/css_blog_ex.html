	  <h2>Have You Guys Heard of Marie Kondo?</h2>
		<p class="p1">It's great! I tore my house apart and ruthlesly got rid of items that didn't bring me joy! </p>
		<p>This rake? Fuck it! I hate raking.</p>
		<p>This can opener? Boring! I think I'm going to switch to soylent anyway.</p>
		<p>Now I only have things I love. I think I might get rid of more. Some minimalists think you shouldn't own more than 5 things.</p>

	  <h2>I'm A Minimalist Now!</h2>
		<p class="p1">I sold all my furniture and put my mattress on the floor. I did buy a very fancy coffee machine with the money I got for all the furniture. Every morning I wake up and make an elaborate cup of coffee and look at my cold empty apartment. It's great! I also never wear color now. In fact I wear the same outfit every day. </p>

		<p>Religously. </p>
